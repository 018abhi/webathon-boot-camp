A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another
 function and is executed after the completion of that function. 
This approach allows asynchronous operations,
 meaning tasks can run in the background without blocking the main program flow.

for example : 
 1: function greeting(name) {
     console.log('Hello ' + name);
     }
  
 2: function visitor(callback) {
    var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
    callback(name);
     }

     visitor(greeting);
