for Loop The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of code.
 It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 4.

while Loop The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
 It's useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

This loop will also print the numbers from 0 to 4.

do...while  :> Loop The do...while loop is similar to the while loop,
 but it ensures that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.


let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 4.

for...in Loop ---> The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object (including arrays).


let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key + ": " + obj[key]);
}
This loop will print each key-value pair in the object.

for...of Loop --->  The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc. It allows you to loop through the values of an iterable.


let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}
This loop will print the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
